### Hey there! I’m Vasant Kumar Mogia,

An undergrad in Information Technology from India—currently.
If I recall now I'm soon going to be a Junior <br>
And I don't have an Intern lol XD *Gulp,<br>
Hopefully later (Lets Hope 🙏)

I go by DSCmatter on [GitHub ](https://github.com/DSCmatter)**(⁄⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄⁄)**. I’m passionate about backend development, software engineering, and building fun, real-world tech projects. From creating things like APIs, Low level systems to tinkering with cloud, Docker, Data and Python/JavaScript/Go stacks—I’m always exploring and learning.

Outside of code, you’ll find me gaming, lost in fantasy novels, or pretending I’m not thinking about career stuff **(˶˃⤙˂˶)**. <br>
I’ve also been diving into open source, AWS some bit of Data Science and catching up on algorithms. Yes, even though I lowkey hate Leetcode  **(っ- ‸ - ς)**.

This space is my little internet nook for thoughts, projects, and tech rambles. <br>
Don't be shy, don't be embarassed feel to connect or just say hi!

P.S. Still figuring things out, still building, still dreaming. If you’ve got cool ideas, good vibes, or just want to nerd out about tech—my inbox is open **ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧**
