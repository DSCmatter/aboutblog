### Hey there! I’m Vasant,

An IT undergrad from India, soon to be a Junior. Currently, I’m diving into backend development, software engineering, and tech projects using APIs, cloud, Docker, and Python/JavaScript/Go. Outside coding, I enjoy gaming, reading fantasy novels, and occasionally daydreaming about my career.

I’m also exploring open source, AWS, and algorithms (though Leetcode isn’t my favorite). Find me on GitHub as DSCmatter, and feel free to reach out if you want to chat tech or just say hi! **ദ്ദി(˵ •̀ ᴗ - ˵ ) ✧**
