### The GOAT of 2025

A really, really great game from such a small team — truly a contender for GOTY!

My playtime was around 36 hours, and it was one hell of a journey.
Although I don’t usually write much about games, this was one unforgettable experience!
And since I’ve started this blog, I figured I might as well write something.

Turn-based RPGs hold a special place in my heart.
As someone who has played Persona 3 Reload, Refantazio, and the Pokémon games, this one felt like a fresh take—almost like a AAA-quality title from a smaller team.

Even though I couldn’t enjoy the full glory of its graphics due to my aging GTX 1650, it still looked great on low settings.

I genuinely loved every moment—the battles, the story, and above all, the [music](https://open.spotify.com/album/5epJvt9jHbYI1j6WqCppGc?si=l_DMjew8R22zp-vAVdP6HQ).
It’s the kind of soundtrack that stays with you—emotional, immersive, and addicting, even after the credits roll.

Remember, Tomorrow comes.

Below, I’ve embedded the soundtrack. Feel free to give it a listen:
